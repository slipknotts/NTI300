Apache vs NginX

1) main difference between these two different servers is NginX is solely a static server it has to send any dynamic content to
   another device and wait for it to send the processed content back. 

2) next biggest difference is process consumption, Apache creates a new process for every request where NginX can handle
   multiple requests in the same process.

3) Apache allows for additional, advanced configuration on a per directory level (.htaccess); NginX has no such advanced
   configuration support.

There are additional differences but these three seemed like the most significant ones to me and from what I can tell, unless you 
	need special permissions for certain directories or dynamic processes handled directly within the server, NginX appears to be
	the smaller, faster, cheaper web server for most of your heavenly slices of divine web content.
